<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<hr>

Using Artificial Intelligence in the legal system is still in its embryonic stage, but is gradually being accepted by various countries, law offices and judiciaries. Lawyers, while arguing cases, need to put a lot of time into legal research of hundreds of relevant cases and  thousands of pages of decisions to deduce the right cases that are in favor of their clientâ€™s motion or application. Lawyers can also get an approximate judgment based on relevant IPC sections. On exploration, we found that there is not a lot of work done and we believe there is a huge potential to automate and improve the efficiency of the process.Artificial Intelligence has the flair to analyze legitimate information based on semantics and make predictions and hence helping the judiciary system with automation.
Methodical use of data in the judiciary can minimize the burden on pertinent personnel, refine the case-handling efficiency, enhance trial quality, and elevate fair enforcement.Predicting outcomes of legal cases may help in the interpretation of the judicial decision-making process. The intricacies of case-specific legal factors can be drawn out from legal judgments.
By making use of  the legal knowledge contained in huge law articles and case judgment documents, we will try to provide an approximate judgment to a given case fact as input.
The goal of this project is to build systems that provide assistance in easing/speed up the judicial processes. More specifically, we would like to predict the probable judgment of criminal cases to provide assistance in the decision-making process of the judiciary proceedings. This can be quite challenging. One of the key obstacles is the absence of proper structured, reliable data sources. This is very important as the entire project builds on this set of data.
Another challenge is choosing the model design strategy. On one side, you have regular text processing using the principles of Natural Language Processing strategy. These use complex ideas to find relationships between entities. On the other side, you have neural networks/deep learning strategies. This is kind of a black-box model, as the relationships between entities are realized without human intervention. The former strategy is useful as we can trace the reason for the received output. But it may be hard to model complex relationships using this approach. The deep neural network approach does not explain the reason for the output but is really great to realize complex relationships.
While it is great to model complex relationships, Judiciary is a very sensitive field and every decision must be accountable. Hence we decided to use a hybrid strategy.

<b>PROBLEM DEFINITION</b>
<hr>
The input to the model would be the subsets of the Indian penal Code and case details. The challenge here is to build a model that accepts diverse case details structure. The output would be the probable punishment that could be imposed by the judge after thorough consideration of all the documents presented. This would of course be used as a raw estimate of what the judgement may be. This could also be used during appeals, to check whether there would be a change of decision or not.
